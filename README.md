# Polygonal Model Compression with Graph Symmetries

A tool for compressing polygonal models (in PLY format). Compresses the connectivity data by exploiting symmetries [1].
Implemented as part of the Advanced Computer Graphics course at UL FRI.

### Instructions
Running `python src/mesh_utils.py --help` prints instructions for compressing and decompressing a mesh.
